        If the page loads without any security warnings and you can see the
        "HTTPS Test Page" heading along with the accompanying text, then HTTPS
        is working correctly on your IIS server.
      </p>

        If you see security warning on URL then your SSL Certificate is not
        working
      </h2>
      <p>
        Note: To enable HTTPS on IIS, you will need to obtain an SSL/TLS
        certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) and configure your
        IIS website to use that certificate. Additionally, you need to ensure
        that the necessary bindings and SSL settings are properly configured in
        IIS. This sample page assumes that HTTPS is already set up correctly.
